## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/EDUSolution/AutoEDU/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
```
These script support the automation of deployment for the Modern Data Warehouse.
It removes the infrastructure steps for the data analyst or data scientist so they can work with the essential business of data
vs. the Azure resources behind it.
The scripts are interactive and dynamically fill in the requirements, removing the need to build out everything in the portal.

A log file is generated in the end with the name of the resoruces, passwords, etc.
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EDUSolution/AutoEDU/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
